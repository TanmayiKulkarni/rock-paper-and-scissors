# rock-paper-and-scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a basic JavaScript game built to practice fundamental web development skills. It allows the user to play against the computer, with randomized computer choices and real-time results displayed on the screen. The project uses HTML for structure, CSS for basic styling, and JavaScript for the core game logic and interactivity.

This project was created as part of my learning journey in JavaScript. It helped me understand key concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and working with functions. While it's a simple game, it was a valuable hands-on exercise in building dynamic behavior in a web page.
